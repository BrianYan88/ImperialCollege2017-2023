    "The symmetry properties of a molecular structure are important in determining the spectroscopic and electronic structure properties of molecules. In this assignment you will need to write one (or two) standalone python programs to determine some of the symmetry properties of a properly aligned molecular structure given in an XYZ file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although it is possible to write a program that determines the full symmetry point group of a structure, we will deal with simpler problem focussing on a subset of symmetry elements. The assignment is divided in two parts. Part 1 considers the symmetry operations of the $\\mathcal{C}_{2v}$ group, and the goal is to write a program that indicates if the structure belongs or contains the $\\mathcal{C}_{2v}$ symmetry point group or not. Part 2 can be seen as an extension of part 1, where the program to be written makes a finer classification of the structure among the different $\\mathcal{C}$ point group types.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 1 (5 marks)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise you should write a standalone python program, called *isC2v.py*, that prompts the user for the name of an XYZ file, and after that prints\n",

    "    -> False\n",
    "    \n",
    "if that is not the case. It is important that the line starts with the characters '->' as this will be used to test the output of your program. Your program can output any other text you wish above or below your result (as long as it does *not* start with ->).\n",
    "\n",
    "In writing your program you can assume the following alignment for the structure in the XYZ file:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The principle axis of symmetry is aligned with the *z* axis.\n",
    "* If vertical reflection planes exist, at least one will coincide with the *xz* or *yz* planes.\n",
    "* If a horizontal reflection plane exist, it will coincide with the *xy* plane.\n",
    "* If a centre of inversion exists, it will correspond to the origin of the coordinate system *(0,0,0)*.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a molecular structure to contain the $\\mathcal{C}_{2v}$ point group it needs to contain 4 elements of symmetry:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The identity $\\hat{E}$ (which is uninteresting and we don't need to consider further)\n",
    "* A rotational axis of symmetry $\\hat{C}_2$\n",
    "* 2 vertical reflection planes $\\hat{\\sigma}_v(xz)$ and $\\hat{\\sigma}_v(yz)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to verify that a structure has a given element of symmetry, one needs to perform the corresponding coordinate transformation and check if the resulting structure is equivalent to the initial one. A coordinate transformation can be performed by multiplying a matrix by the coordinates of all atoms.\n",

    "For a $\\hat{C}_n$ rotation around the *z* axis, one needs to multiply the coordinates of all atoms by:\n",

    "If your implementation is functional (i.e. your program does not crash) but does not fully work for a generic case, partial marks will be awarded for correct implementation of the functions below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation suggestion\n",
    "\n",
    "A working solution can be obtained by appropriately combining the following functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### parse_line(*string*) - 0.5 marks\n",
    "\n",
    "This function should receive one string as its argument (a line of the XYZ file) and return a list of the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "    [element_symbol,coordinate_array]\n",
    "\n",
    "where element_symbol is a string with the chemical symbol letter(s), and coordinate_array is an array of numbers with the atom coordinates. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ['C', array([17.72600, 19.88100, 6.66900])]\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### load_structure(*file_stream*) - 0.5 marks (implies having parse_line() working)\n",
    "\n",
    "This function should receive a file stream of an XYZ file (the result an open(filename,'r') operation), and return a list of sub-lists with the structure of the molecule, where each sub-list has the same format as the output of parse_line(). For the $H_2S$ molecule, the output could look something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "    [['S',array([0.00000000,0.00000000,0.10224900])],\n",
    "     ['H',array([0.00000000,0.96805900,-0.81799200])],\n",
    "     ['H',array([0.00000000,-0.96805900,-0.81799200])]]\n",
    "     \n",
    "**Note**: the function load_structure() should receive a file stream object as an argument, *not* a string with a file name.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### equivalent_atoms(*list1*,*list2*) - 0.5 marks\n",
    "\n",
    "This function should receive two lists as arguments, each with the same format as output by parse_line(). It should return a boolean, True or False, depending on whether the 2 lists represent equivalent atoms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because comparing two atom positions to infinite precision is not possible in a computer, we need to set a tolerance. So we will consider that the positions of the atoms are identical if the norm of the difference of the two position vectors is less than 0.01&Aring;.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### equivalent_structures(*list1*,*list2*) - 0.5 marks (implies having equivalent_atoms() working)\n",
    "\n",
    "This function should receive two lists as arguments, each with the same format as output by load_structure(). It should return a boolean, True or False, depending on whether the 2 lists represent equivalent structures according to the criteria set in equivalent_atoms(). Note that equivalent atoms don't need to be in the same position in list1 and list2.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### coordinate_transformation(*array*,*list*) - 1 mark\n",
    "\n",
    "This function should receive as arguments an array corresponding to a 3&times;3 transformation matrix, and a list with the same format as the output of load_structure(). It should return a new list with the same format as output by load_structure() but with the coordinates transformed by the transformation matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### principle_axis(*list*) - 1 mark\n",
    "\n",
    "This function should receive a list with a molecular structure with the same format as the output of load_structure(), and it should return an integer *n*, where *n* is a number from 1 to 6 corresponding to the highest order symmetry axis aligned with *z*.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: this function has more functionality than that strictly needed if we just want to confirm the $\\mathcal{C}_{2v}$ symmetry. It is however fit for purpose, and it is useful to attempt Part 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 2 (1 mark)\n",
    "\n",
    "This part of the exercise can be seen as an extension of Part 1, as with little more effort your program can provide much more detailed information about the symmetry of the molecular structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering two more symmetry elements: the centre of inversion $\\hat{i}$ and the horizontal reflection plane $\\hat{\\sigma}_h(xy)$, with associate coordinate transformation matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\underline{\\underline{i}}=\\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc} -1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{array}\\right]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\underline{\\underline{\\sigma_h}}(xy)=\\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{array}\\right]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and the same functions in the suggested implementation above, it is possible to the $\\mathcal{C}$ type point group the structure contains (excluding the $\\mathcal{C}_{\\infty}$ linear case). This corresponds to implementing the logical procedure encoded in a subsection of the [point group flow chart](C_groups_flow_chart.png).\n",
    "\n",
    "For this part, you should write a standalone python program called *whichCgroup.py* which asks the user for the name of an XYZ file, and after that a string of the form\n",
    "\n",
    "    -> pointgroup\n",
    "    \n",
    "where *pointgroup* can be 'C1','Cs''Cn','Cnv' or 'Cnh', with n from 2 up to 6, depending on the highest $\\mathcal{C}$ type symmetry group that the molecular structure contains. It is important that the line start with the characters '->' as this will be used to test the output of your program. Your program can output any other text you wish above or below your result (as long as it does *not* start with ->).\n",
    "\n",
    "As with Part 1, your program will be tested against the XYZ files provided and a blind set of test cases. No partial marks are awarded for defective implementations (the functions are the same as in Part 1). "

    "You should submit to Blackboard one or two files, depending on whether you are attempting just part 1 or part 2 as well, called *isC2v.py* and *whichCgroup.py*, each containing a standalone Python script with your program. Your program should not crash when given a well formatted XYZ file. Any program that does not fulfil this criteria will not be considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the same zip archive you will find a template for *isC2v.py*. Separate the function definition from the rest of your program which you should write inside the *if* block provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you choose to follow the suggested implementation, in order to qualify for partial marks, it is important that you define the functions name and argument order *exactly* as listed above. We will test that parse_line(), load_structure(), equivalent_atoms(), equivalent_structure(), coordinate_transformation() and principle_axis() are present and behave appropriately. Functions that work correctly but are called different names will not result in partial marks being awarded. For the functions to be tested they need to be imported via an *import* statement, so it is advisable that you check you are able to import you functions from the *isC2v.py* file.\n",
